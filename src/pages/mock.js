			'{"name":"Mobin Shaterian","job_title":"Golang Developer | Senior Software Engineer","about_section":"When I was 8 years old, I was enthusiastic about computers. I was wondering how it works or if it is real magic. At 13 years old I found Herbert Sheild\'s CPP book and read it cautiously and obsessively. In 16 years, I read Deitel \\u0026 Deitel\\nCPP books more than 3 times and participated in robotics student competitions. Yes, I am passionate about computers, even my subconscious has a deep connection with computer fields.\\nI chose computer science for my bachelor\'s degree and graduated with the highest score. At that time, companies didn\'t care about computer science and I learned many things about software engineering and becoming a web developer to earn money.\\nBased on my interest in computers and mathematics I decided to learn artificial intelligence in my Master\'s degree. I used a machine learning algorithm to categorize patients in the hospital based on the type of pain.\\nI was enthusiastic about AI but because I was an expert in web development and PHP language, companies offered me a backend developer position. Then I went to an AI company and connected their AI system to a web developer and learned huge about data engineer and how it can handle huge amount of data and request in the back-end system.\\nPHP-fpm I hate you, this is my first article about PHP, about the problem inside of PHP and then I decided to switch to Golang language.\\nBecause I care about patients, I built a COVID application to predict the percentage of deaths between people. Riskeman was the name of the application, I was my first Golang programmer. The health government advertises Riskeman on Iranian national TV, and we can handle 8 million requests per day. Because our DevOps manager had gone, I learned about Kubernetes and GitLab CI/CD and ran infrastructure in HIS system in the hospital.\\nThen I went to the financial company and used Golang in big company that handles 10k requests per second.\\nNowadays, I work in a blockchain company as a Golang backend developer and focus on blockchain technologies to build a decentralized blockchain ecosystem for KYC clients in other businesses.\\nAfter 17 years I am still in love with computers and new technologies.","experience_section":"Experience\\nGolang Developer | Senior Software Engineer\\nGolang Developer | Senior Software Engineer\\nSnappTrip · Full-time\\nSnappTrip · Full-time\\nDec 2024 - Present · 4 mos\\nDec 2024 to Present · 4 mos\\nTehran, Tehran Province, Iran · Hybrid\\nTehran, Tehran Province, Iran · Hybrid\\nSkills: Go (Programming Language) · PostgreSQL\\nGo (Programming Language) · PostgreSQL\\nCoDeTech\\nCoDeTech\\nFull-time · 1 yr 9 mos\\nFull-time · 1 yr 9 mos\\nRemote\\nRemote\\nData Scientist\\nData Scientist\\nJan 2024 - Sep 2024 · 9 mos\\nJan 2024 to Sep 2024 · 9 mos\\nBratislava, Slovakia\\nBratislava, Slovakia\\nDesign auto-response CRM tickets, It has made AI model-based and uses LLM with Python. \\nTopic modeling algorithm for cluster tickets and made a knowledge base based on data-driven data.\\nDesign auto-response CRM tickets, It has made AI model-based and uses LLM with Python.
